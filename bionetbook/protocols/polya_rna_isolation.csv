Protocol Name,Isolation of Poly(A) + RNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Input,"Nucleic Acid, RNA, total",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Output,"Nucleic Acid, RNA, poly(A)+",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remarks,"This protocol separates poly(A)+ RNA from the remainder of total RNA, which is largely rRNA and tRNA. Total RNA is denatured to expose the poly(A) (polyadenylated) tails. Poly(A)-containing RNA is then bound to oligo(dT) cellulose, with the remainder of the RNA washing through. The poly(A)+ RNA is eluted by removing salt from the solution, thus destabilizing the dT:rA hybrid. The column can then be repeated to remove contaminating poly(A)_ RNA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remarks,"The following solutions should be treated with DEPC to inhibit RNase activity: water, 10M LiCl, 3 M sodium acetate. See UNIT 4.1, reagents and solutions, for instructions.
