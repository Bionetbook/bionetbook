    min_time: '2.5'
    remark: illumina recommends diluting their adapter oligo mix at a ratio of 1:10
      with water before use. if a low amount of starting material was used, dilute
      the illumina adapters 1:30, as excess adapters can interfere with sequencing.
      the adapters may have to be titrated as excess adapters can interfere with sequencing.
      the adapters may have to be titrated relative to starting material; see troubleshooting
      for more details.

    remark: elute in a final volume of 23 _l buffer eb. if a large starting amount
      of rna was used, a qiaquick pcr purification kit can be used instead of agarose
      gel purification. however, to ensure a higher-quality library, we recommend
      performing agarose gel purification to remove excess free adapters prior to
      illumina sequencing. adapters can multimerize if this step is not  performed.
