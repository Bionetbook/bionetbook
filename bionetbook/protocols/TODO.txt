files to debug:

1. PCR amplification : multiple verbs in thermocycyling
2. action is not started for some reason:
	a. Size select amplificaiton - done
	b. dna extraciton bone - done
	c. gel extraction qiaquick 
	d. qiaquick pcr purification
	e. qiagen gel extraction
3. qiaquick cr amplificaion: remarks are binary
4. Any protocol with step options: make into a new version

Protocols to do:
	PCR amplification - later
	Size select amp'ed cDNA - fixed step line start, cleared ul.
	DONE: gel extraction DNA - fix remarks on Protocol{'remarks'} 
	qiagen gel extraction
	open wet ware protocols


Make a protocol class:
	instance data input: open(<input>.yaml)
	write out accessor methods for different features:
	Schedule: getschedulingdata.py
	Reagent lists: getreagents.py

	function outputs: 
		- List of sorted dicts [{},{},{}]
		- Dicts with internal references: max_conc needs to be directed to conc_units
