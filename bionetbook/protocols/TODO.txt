files to debug:

1. PCR amplification : multiple verbs in thermocycyling
2. action is not started for some reason:
 
	a. gel_extraction_qiaquick.csv -- utf-8 error 
	b. qiaquick_pcr_purification.csv -- utf-8 error
	c. agarose_gel_electro.csv -- utf-8 error


3. Any protocol with step options: make into a new version


Protocols to do:
	PCR amplification - later
	DONE: gel extraction DNA - fix remarks on Protocol{'remarks'} 
	qiagen gel extraction
	open wet ware protocols


	function outputs: 
	All outputs are in .yaml
		- List of sorted dicts [{},{},{}]
		- Dicts with internal references: max_conc needs to be directed to conc_units


A protocol instance:
1. User takes protocol and uses as is, no changes to values - only scheduling instance
2. User changes a value of a volume
3. User changes a concentration
4. User changes a reagent name / stock num / supplier
5. User changes a machine model
6. User changes a machine type
7. User changes a strain name / strain batch num / strain source
8. User changes a model organism


Calendar:
create a calendar
Figure out time zones. 
Look for conflicts
raise event start/stop errors. 
make a protocol schedule with time additions
group events into 30 min increments. 
Upload a new schedule to ical through bash
