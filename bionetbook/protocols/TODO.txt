files to debug:

1. PCR amplification : multiple verbs in thermocycyling
2. action is not started for some reason:
	a. Size select amplificaiton - done
	b. dna extraciton bone - done
	c. gel extraction qiaquick 
	d. qiaquick pcr purification
	e. qiagen gel extraction
3. qiaquick cr amplificaion: remarks are binary
4. Any protocol with step options: make into a new version

Protocols to do:
	PCR amplification - later
	Size select amp'ed cDNA - fixed step line start, cleared ul.
	DONE: gel extraction DNA - fix remarks on Protocol{'remarks'} 
	qiagen gel extraction
	open wet ware protocols


Make a protocol class:
	instance data input: open(<input>.yaml)
	write out accessor methods for different features:
	Schedule: getschedulingdata.py
	Reagent lists: getreagents.py

	function outputs: 
	All outputs are in .yaml
		- List of sorted dicts [{},{},{}]
		- Dicts with internal references: max_conc needs to be directed to conc_units


A protocol instance:
1. User takes protocol and uses as is, no changes to values - only scheduling instance
2. User changes a value of a volume
3. User changes a concentration
4. User changes a reagent name / stock num / supplier
5. User changes a machine model
6. User changes a machine type
7. User changes a strain name / strain batch num / strain source
8. User changes a model organism
