Protocol Name,QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit Protocol,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Input,Band of DNA excised from agarose gel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Output,purified DNA,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remarks,"This protocol is designed to extract and purify DNA of 70 bp to 10 kb from standard or low-melt agarose gels in TAE or TBE buffer. Up to 400 mg agarose can be processed per spin column. This kit can also be used for DNA cleanup from enzymatic reactions (see page 8). For DNA cleanup from enzymatic reactions using this protocol, add 3 volumes of Buffer QG and 1 volume of isopropanol to the reaction, mix, and proceed with step 6 of the protocol. Alternatively, use the new MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Remarks,The yellow color of Buffer QG indicates a pH ²7.5.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reference PMID,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reference URL,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reference,"QIAquick¨ Spin Handbook, March 2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,Category Tags,DNA Purification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Specifier Tags,"Qiagen, QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Step Number,Step Text,Action,Attribute,,,,,,,,,,,,1,Add ethanol (96Ð100%) to Buffer PE before use (see bottle label for volume).,add,what - component list,Reagent name,Min Mass,Max Mass,Mass Units,Min Vol,Max Vol,Vol Units,Min Conc,Max Conc,Conc Units,pH,Note,,,,Ethanol,,,,See bottle label,See bottle label,,96,100,%,,,,,where,to Buffer PE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,remarks,Conditional: If ethanol has not already been added to Buffer PE,,,,,,,,,,,,,,duration,Min Time,Max Time,Time Units,Duration Comment,,,,,,,,,,,,1,1,minutes,Active; Conditional,,,,,,,,2,"Excise the DNA fragment from the agarose gel with a clean, sharp scalpel.
