Input: Nucleic Acid, RNA, total
Name: Isolation of Poly(A) + RNA
Output: Nucleic Acid, RNA, poly(A)+
Reference_DOI: ''
Reference_PMID: 'The following solutions should be treated with DEPC to inhibit RNase
  activity: water, 10M LiCl, 3 M sodium acetate. See UNIT 4.1, reagents and solutions,
  for instructions. CAUTION: DEPC is a suspected carcinogen and should be handled
  carefully.'
Reference_URL: '18265239'
Remarks: This protocol separates poly(A)+ RNA from the remainder of total RNA, which
  is largely rRNA and tRNA. Total RNA is denatured to expose the poly(A) (polyadenylated)
  tails. Poly(A)-containing RNA is then bound to oligo(dT) cellulose, with the remainder
  of the RNA washing through. The poly(A)+ RNA is eluted by removing salt from the
  solution, thus destabilizing the dT:rA hybrid. The column can then be repeated to
  remove contaminating poly(A)_ RNA.
