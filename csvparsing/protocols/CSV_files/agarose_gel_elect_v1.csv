To facilitate visualization of DNA fragments during the run, ethidium bromide solution can be added to the electrophoresis buffer to a final concentration of 0.5 µg/ml. If buffer is prepared for the electrophoresis tank and the gel separately, be sure to bring both to an identical concentration of ethidium bromide.

Melt the agarose in a microwave oven or autoclave and swirl to ensure even mixing. Gels typically contain 0.8 to 1.5% agarose (see Critical Parameters, Agarose Concentration). Melted agarose should be cooled to 55ÁC in a water bath before pouring onto the gel platform. This prevents warping of the gel apparatus. Gels are typically poured between 0.5 and 1 cm thick.
